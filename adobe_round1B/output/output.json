Hence it is also termed as weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in unpredictable \nways if it goes beyond its limits. \n \nApple Siri's a good example of Narrow AI, but it operates with a limited pre-defined \nrange of functions. \n \nIBM's Watson supercomputer also comes under Narrow AI, as it uses an Expert system \napproach combined with Machine learning and natural language processing. \n \nSome Examples of Narrow AI are playing chess, purchasing suggestions on e-commerce \nsite, self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image recognition.",
